# Neutreeko

Neutreeko is a 5x5 board game. There are two players: Black and White. The initial position of the pieces is fixed and given initially. Its objective is for the player to place his three pieces in a line, orthogonally or diagonally, with the three connected. The game starts from the player who controls the black pieces. The players, on their turn, move each of their pieces alternately. The piece runs through the cells, in a straight line, orthogonally or diagonally until it finds an occupied cell or the edge of the board. The game is said to be a draw if the same position occurs three times in a row.
